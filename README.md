# Multi-Omics Data Integration with Graph Neural Networks

## 📌 Description

This repository provides a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based framework for **multi-omics data integration**, enabling the discovery of complex biological patterns across genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and other omics layers.

By modeling biological entities as nodes and their relationships as edges, the framework leverages GNNs to capture **non-linear, high-dimensional interactions** that traditional methods often miss.

## 🚀 Features

* 🧬 Integration of multiple omics datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.)
* 🔗 Graph-based representation of omics data
* 🧠 Graph Neural Network implementation for predictive modeling
* 📊 Support for classification and clustering tasks
* ⚡ Extensible and modular code for custom datasets and models
